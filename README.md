# LionTrade
The platform, letâ€™s call it "LionTrade", will connect sellers (e.g., farmers, electricians, mobile shop owners, small business owners) with buyers in Sri Lanka. Sellers can register, create profiles, list their goods/services, and publish them. Buyers can browse listings, get notified of relevant items, and contact sellers directly.
